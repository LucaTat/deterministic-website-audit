# Deterministic Website Audit (v1.0)

A strict, evidence-based website audit designed for agencies.
Deterministic findings only. AI advisory is optional and cannot modify findings.

## What you get
- Audit PDF (client-ready)
- audit.json (structured findings + evidence)
- EN / RO supported
- Batch runs for multiple targets

## What we check (v1.0)
- Conversion clarity signals (booking, contact, services, pricing)
- Social presence signals
- Share preview metadata (Open Graph + Twitter cards)
- Indexability & Technical Access (robots, noindex, canonicals, redirects, sitemap discovery + sampling)
- Conservative Conversion Loss Estimator (ranges + confidence)

## What we do NOT do
- No SEO scores, no PageSpeed/Lighthouse
- No crawling beyond homepage + important URLs
- No AI-generated findings or severity
- No speculative claims about rankings or traffic

## Why agencies use it
- Fast proof of value in the first call
- Evidence screenshots/snippets reduce back-and-forth
- Deterministic outputs are repeatable and defensible
