# v1.0 Freeze – Deterministic Core

v1.0 is feature-complete.

## Included pillars
- Conversion clarity signals
- Social signals
- Share metadata checks
- Conversion Loss Estimator v1 (conservative)
- Indexability & Technical Access pack v1
- EN / RO narratives
- PDF export
- AI Advisory (read-only, downstream, optional)

## Explicitly out of scope for v1
- Crawling beyond homepage + important URLs
- PageSpeed / Lighthouse / CWV
- SEO scores or composite grades
- Keyword rankings
- Backlink analysis
- UX opinions
- AI-generated findings or severity

## Rule
Any new idea must target v1.1+ and must not:
- weaken determinism
- fabricate impact
- introduce crawling creep
