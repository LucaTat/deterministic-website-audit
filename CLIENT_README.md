# How to Read This Website Audit

This audit is deterministic, evidence-based, and intentionally conservative.

## What this audit is
- A technical and conversion clarity assessment
- Based only on verifiable signals
- Reproducible with a browser or curl
- Conservative in estimates and language

## What this audit is NOT
- Not an SEO score
- Not a performance test
- Not a ranking or keyword analysis
- Not AI speculation

## Severity levels
- **Fail**: A direct technical or conversion blocker
- **Warning**: Can reduce visibility, trust, or clarity
- **Info**: Low-risk or best-practice observation

## Conversion Loss Estimates
- Shown as ranges, not single numbers
- Only included when evidence supports an estimate
- Confidence level is always stated

## Indexability & Technical Access
This section checks whether important pages:
- can be crawled (robots.txt)
- can be indexed (noindex directives)
- resolve correctly (status & redirects)
- are correctly canonicalized
- are represented correctly in sitemaps

No crawling, no guessing, no scoring.

## AI Advisory (Experimental)
- Reads findings only
- Cannot create, modify, or re-score findings
- Clearly marked as experimental
- Skipped entirely if unavailable
